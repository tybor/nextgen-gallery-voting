== Description ==

This plugin adds the ability for users to vote on NextGEN Galleries.  A few basic options give you the ability to limit who can vote on what.

NGG Voting was inspired by a request from [Troy Schlegel of Schlegel Photography](http://www.schlegelphotography.com/).  Currently it only allows voting on galleries, but I am considering adding the option to vote on individual images if the repsonse shows a need for it (and the NextGEN code allows for it).

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the plugin to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to 'Manage Gallery' in NextGEN, and select a gallery to see the new options
